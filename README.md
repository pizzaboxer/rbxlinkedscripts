# rbxlinkedscripts

 An archived collection of classic Roblox LinkedScripts.

 These specifically are scripts that are no longer available to download from Roblox due to relatively recent changes in asset privacy policies, which also means that any tools which used these are now broken.
 
 These were primarily used for the classic brickbattle tools, but may also be used by other tools that reused the basic GUI scripts (like SwordGUIV2).

 All scripts here were sourced from the [Roblox Forum Archive](https://archive.froast.io).
